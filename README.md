# Mask-Detection
Face mask detection is the process of determining whether or not someone is wearing a mask. We all know that wearing masks is one of the most effective ways to prevent the virus from spreading. Despite this, we notice a lot of people not wearing masks in public locations. Using AI approaches to construct a system that can recognize persons who arenâ€™t wearing masks could be a solution to this problem.
Detection of face masks in public places is a real challenge that needs to be addressed to reduce the risk of spreading the virus. To address these challenges, an automated system for face mask detection.

## Advantages :

## What is the need of face mask detection?
The Face Mask Detection System can be used at office premises to detect if employees are maintaining safety standards at work. It monitors employees without masks and sends them a reminder to wear a mask.

## What are the Use Cases of the Face Mask Detection System?
These face mask detection systems are broadly used in the crowded sector to protect the millennials from the deadly infection of the coronavirus. Out of many, some of the major areas where this system is broadly used, are listed below:

##### 1) Airports- 
With the rise of the Covd-19 pandemic, the use of a face mask detection system is quite needed because this is the place where chances of the spread of the virus are high. The facemask detection system captures the face of the traveler at the entrance, then inside the airport, if a traveler is found without a mask, then the picture of that particular individual is sent to the airport authorities to take immediate action.
##### 2) Offices and Organizations- 
As some organizations are unable to transform their work culture virtually, for those organizations, to maintain the safety standards at the workplace, face mask detection systems are used. The system helps employees to get the remainder of wearing masks and further helps the organization to maintain a safe work environment in the office premises for employees.
##### 3)Hospitals- 
These face mask detection systems are useful inside the hospitals to monitor whether the staff is properly wearing their masks inside the campus during their shifts. Further, these face mask detection systems can send a reminder to the quarantine people who need to wear a mask. This sends an alert to the people to take care of themselves.
